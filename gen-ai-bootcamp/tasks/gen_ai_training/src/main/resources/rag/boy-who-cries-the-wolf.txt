The Tale of Finn and Fang

Finn was a young shepherd boy tasked with watching the village's flock on the hillside. He found the job incredibly dull. Day after day, it was just sheep, grass, and sky. Finn longed for excitement.

One afternoon, seized by a mischievous impulse, Finn cupped his hands around his mouth and yelled, "Wolf! Wolf! A wolf is attacking the sheep!"

The villagers, hearing his desperate cries, grabbed their pitchforks and axes and raced up the hill, out of breath and worried. But when they arrived, they found Finn sitting calmly among the grazing sheep, a wide grin on his face. There was no wolf.

"Finn!" scolded the village elder, Elara. "Why did you cry wolf? There's no danger here!"

Finn just shrugged. "I was bored," he mumbled. The villagers, frustrated and annoyed at having been tricked, warned Finn sternly not to do it again.

A few days later, Finnâ€™s boredom returned with a vengeance. He looked out across the fields, the sun shining brightly. He saw a shadow move at the edge of the woods and his mischievous mind took over. He cried out again, "Wolf! Wolf! It's back! Help!"

Once more, the villagers hurried up the hill, only to find Finn laughing. They were furious. Elara looked at him with disappointment. "Finn," she said, "If you cry wolf when there is none, no one will believe you when a wolf truly comes."

Then, one late afternoon, as the sun began to dip below the horizon, a real wolf emerged from the forest. It was a large, grey wolf with sharp teeth and glowing yellow eyes. This was Fang, a cunning hunter who had been watching the flock for days. Fang stalked among the sheep, scattering them in panic.

Finn, terrified, screamed at the top of his lungs, "Wolf! Wolf! It's Fang! He's attacking the sheep! Help us!"

But this time, no one came. The villagers heard Finn's cries, but they remembered his previous tricks. "He's just trying to fool us again," they muttered, going back to their chores and evening meals.

Fang, unimpeded, seized several sheep and dragged them back into the forest. Finn watched in horror, his cries echoing unanswered across the valley. He had learned a harsh lesson: no one believes a liar, even when they are telling the truth. The cost of his deception was the loss of the sheep and the trust of his village.
